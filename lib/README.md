# External Libraries

This project is configured to work only with the JARs provided by the instructors
and the approved dependencies already placed in this folder. Ensure the following
file names are present in `lib/` and refresh the Eclipse project:

- `amqp-client.jar` (RabbitMQ Java client)
- `cliente_http.jar` (HTTP client provided by instructors)
- `STC-DAO.jar` (STC DAO library provided by instructors)
- `mysql-connector-java.jar` (MySQL JDBC driver)

If your file names differ, rename them to match these entries so the existing
`.classpath` can load them without modification.
